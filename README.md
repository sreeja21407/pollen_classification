🌾 Pollen Profiling - Automated Classification of Pollen Grains
Welcome to Pollen Profiling, a deep learning-based project for classifying pollen grains from microscopic images using TensorFlow and Keras.

🚀 Project Overview
This project aims to automatically classify pollen grain species using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on high-resolution microscopic images.

Key Features:

✅ Custom-trained Keras model (model.h5)

✅ Preprocessed pollen dataset (excluded from Git)

✅ Flask-based interactive web application

✅ Label encoder for decoding model predictions
